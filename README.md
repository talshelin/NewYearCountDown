# NewYearCountDown
Our project involves creating a New Year's countdown for 2026 using JavaScript. Our countdown timer will dynamically generate these numbers and retrieve the current date and time from the user's computer. It will continuously update, providing users with an accurate display of the time remaining until the start of 2026.
